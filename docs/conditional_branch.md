## A prototype for Conditional Branching constraints

Move circuits are smart contract specific circuits. The bytecode of the smart contract is “compiled”
directly into the circuit. To handle conditional branching, ProgramBlock was introduced to express the
control flow. During execution zkMove dynamically identifies the ProgramBlock, and if the ProgramBlock
contains conditional branching, the branches will be processed separately.

### ProgramBlock

Data structure:

```
pub struct Block<F: FieldExt> {
    pc: u16,
    start: u16,
    end: Option<u16>,
    locals: Locals<F>,
    code: Vec<Bytecode>,
    condition: Option<F>,
}

pub struct Branch<F: FieldExt> {
    pub block: Block<F>,
    pub is_running: bool, //which arm of conditional branch is running
}

pub struct ConditionalBlock<F: FieldExt> {
    pub true_branch: Option<Branch<F>>,
    pub false_branch: Option<Branch<F>>,
}

pub enum ProgramBlock<F: FieldExt> {
    Block(Block<F>),
    ConditionalBlock(ConditionalBlock<F>),
}
```
Conditional branching is bing identified with specific code patterns. All code patterns should be covered.

A: true and false branches are complete

```
#0, LdU8(0)
#1, StLoc(2)
#2, LdU8(1)
#3, StLoc(3)
#4, CopyLoc(2)
#5, CopyLoc(3)
#6, Eq
#7, BrTrue(9)
#8, Branch(14)

#9, CopyLoc(2)
#10, CopyLoc(3)
#11, Add
#12, StLoc(1)
#13, Branch(18)

#14, CopyLoc(2)
#15, CopyLoc(3)
#16, Mul
#17, StLoc(1)

#18, MoveLoc(1)
#19, Pop
#20, Ret
```

B: only one branch

```
#0, LdU8(0)
#1, StLoc(2)

#17, Add
#18, StLoc(3)

#19, CopyLoc(2)
#20, CopyLoc(3)
#21, Add

```

C: abort in one branch

```

#4, CopyLoc(3)
#5, LdU8(1)
#6, Eq

#9, BrTrue(12)

#10, LdU64(101)
#11, Abort

#12, CopyLoc(3)
#13, LdU8(1)
#14, Add
#15, Pop
#16, Ret
```
